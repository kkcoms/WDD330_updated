    <main>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The app I am building will make monsters with different silly faces. When the user completes a monster, it will make a funny noise and print a fun fact about the monster. The game will function like the old fashioned Mr. Potato head where the user will be able to place facial features on the monster.</p>
        <p>This app serves three purposes: The first is to deepen my understanding of the things that I have learned in class this semester; the second is to prove to my teacher that I have mastered the concepts from class, and the third is its actual functionality. I've decided that creating a fun, artsy app for kids will fulfill all the requirements and be a fulfilling project to spend a lot of time on. </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>This app will be fun for younger children to use. I think it will be ideal for kids ages 4-6 but some slightly older kids, and 6-10 my find it entertaining for a short time. </p>
        <h2>Data sources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>localStorage</h3>
                <p>I am going to save the different monster choices to local storage and return the completed monster from a local JSON file</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>local JSON file</h3>
                <p>I plan to make a local JSON file that has all of the monster information in it. It will reference an SVG file and either an audio element or a text string to go with each picture. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Initial Module list</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>main.js </p></li>
            <li><p>monster.js</p></li>
            <li><p>local_storage.js</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Here is a mockup of the final page with the monster output. The main page will have a similar background with images of different monster bodies, eyes, mouths, and noses to choose from. </p>
        <div class="picture"><img class="picture" src="/monster_wireframe-01.fe7f6bf1.jpg" alt="wireframe"></div>
        <h2>Colors/Typography/specific Element styling</h2>
        <p>Because the audience is small children, the buttons need to be bigger, and the colors need to be brighter. </p>
        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Week 10: Local storage set up and working</p><p>logic figured out and working</p></li>
            <li><p>Week 11: Graphics and JSON file</p></li>
            <li><p>Week 12: CSS animations HTML sounds</p></li>
            <li><p>Week 13: Polish everything and debug</p></li>
        </ul>
