When the user completes a monster, it will make a funny noise and print a fun fact about the monster. The game will function like the old fashioned Mr. Potato head where the user will be able to place facial features on the monster.</p>\n        <p>This app serves three purposes: The first is to deepen my understanding of the things that I have learned in class this semester; the second is to prove to my teacher that I have mastered the concepts from class, and the third is its actual functionality. I've decided that creating a fun, artsy app for kids will fulfill all the requirements and be a fulfilling project to spend a lot of time on. </p>\n        <h2>Audience</h2>\n        <p>This app will be fun for younger children to use. I think it will be ideal for kids ages 4-6 but some slightly older kids, and 6-10 my find it entertaining for a short time. </p>\n        <h2>Data sources</h2>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <h3>localStorage</h3>\n                <p>I am going to save the different monster choices to local storage and return the completed monster from a local JSON file</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <h3>local JSON file</h3>\n                <p>I plan to make a local JSON file that has all of the monster information in it. It will reference an SVG file and either an audio element or a text string to go with each picture. </p>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Initial Module list</h2>\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>main.js </p></li>\n            <li><p>monster.js</p></li>\n            <li><p>local_storage.js</p></li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Wireframes</h2>\n        <p>Here is a mockup of the final page with the monster output. The main page will have a similar background with images of different monster bodies, eyes, mouths, and noses to choose from. </p>\n        <div class=\"picture\"><img class=\"picture\" src=\"/dabd32325e0aeee242bef9a0fe7f6bf1.jpg\" alt=\"wireframe\"></div>\n        <h2>Colors/Typography/specific Element styling</h2>\n        <p>Because the audience is small children, the buttons need to be bigger, and the colors need to be brighter. </p>\n        <h2>Schedule</h2>\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Week 10: Local storage set up and working</p><p>logic figured out and working</p></li>\n            <li><p>Week 11: Graphics and JSON file</p></li>\n            <li><p>Week 12: CSS animations HTML sounds</p></li>\n            <li><p>Week 13: Polish everything and debug</p></li>\n        </ul>\n\n    </main>\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038.js\"></script>\n  \n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"1af50c8e837233671b37e317872b0349","cacheData":{}}
