This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.\"</p>\n        <p>\"Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.\"</p>\n        <h3>Why Validate Forms?</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>We want to get the right data, in the right format.</li>\n          <li>We want to protect our users' data</li>\n          <li>We want to protect ourselves.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Types of Form Validation</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <h4>Built-in form validation</h4>\n            <p> Uses HTML5 form validation features.

This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</p>\n            <p>You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation\n            </p>\n            <h5>Constraint validation API</h5>\n            <p>You may want to impose more complex constraints, or to provide clearer reporting of validation failures than the defaults. This can be done using the Constraint Validation API.</p>\n            <p>\"Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, but it always requires you to think carefully about the user.

You can even pass in an existing request object to create a copy of it</p>\n        <h3>Headers</h3>\n        <p>\"The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor.
